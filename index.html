  <h1>Hello there! Happy 1st birthday to Thea!</h1>
  <p>Sry but life&#39;s full so not much here.</p>
  <p>Now play <a href="Thea 1.puz" download>this crossword that I made with &lt;3</a>. GLHF!</p>
  <p>P.S. Alphacross is buggy, so:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>51 Across should read "Controversial internet slang".</li>
    <li>50 Down should read "Likes TV", which is falsely rendered in 51 Across. But you can&#39;t type directly in 50 Down, so you need to circumvent this by typing on 51 Across. Be smart! üí°</li>
  </ul>
